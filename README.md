# Classification of Pima Indians diabetes
M.L. Project to determine whether people (Pima Indians) have diabetes or not. 

## About the dataset :-
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

In total the dataset has 9 columns, the last column being the outcome.
## Steps :-

* Understanding your data using descriptive statistics and visualization.
* Preprocessing the data to best expose the structure of the problem.
* Spot-checking a number of algorithms using your own test harness.
* Improving results using algorithm parameter tuning.
* Improving results using ensemble methods.
* Finalize and save the model ready for future use.
